## vex2

Vex is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable, easily stylable, and gets out of the way. You'll love vex because it's tiny (`4kb` minified, `1.6kb` minified + gzipped), has a clear and simple API, works on mobile devices, and can be customized to match your style in seconds.

Vex2 is a fork of the original vex repository that is smaller in size, more modular, and has zero dependencies.

For an introduction to vex2, see the [Overview](/OVERVIEW.md). For more detailed API docs, see the [Docs](/docs/intro.md).
