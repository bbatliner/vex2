## vex2

vex is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable, easily stylable, and gets out of the way. You'll love vex because it's tiny (`7.9kb` minified, `3.2kb` minified + gzipped), has a clear and simple API, works on mobile devices, and can be customized to match your style in seconds.

vex2 is a fork of the original [vex repository](https://github.com/HubSpot/vex) that is smaller in size, more modular, and has zero external dependencies.

#### Browser support

vex2 will run in any ES5-compatible environment, and includes polyfills for `classList` and `Object.assign`.

This means the following browsers should work:
- IE 9+
- Firefox 21+
- Chrome 23+
- Safari 6+
- Opera 15+

#### Features
- Tiny footprint and zero external dependencies
- Looks and behaves great on mobile devices
- Easily configurable animations which are smooth as butter
- Open multiple dialogs and close them individually or all at once
- (TODO) Built in CSS spinner for asynchronous dialogs
