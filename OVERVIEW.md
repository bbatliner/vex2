### How To Use Vex

#### Basics of Opening and Passing Content

Create a Vex object by calling `Vex()`.

```javascript
var dialog = Vex()
```

To open a dialog, call `Vex().open`.

```javascript
dialog.open({
    content: 'Hello, World!'
})
```

The user can close the dialog manually, or you can call `Vex().close`.

```javascript
dialog.close()
```
